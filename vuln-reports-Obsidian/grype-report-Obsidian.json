Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.

The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\n\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\n\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","epss":0.00275,"percentile":0.50696,"date":"2025-12-03"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-14.el8_10"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4741","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"58d43c4c825df98c","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.1.1k-14.el8_10","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:ba23add6c8d189365c9e024be58cc3f9c29dd979d85b5d926b8d8b74476e9a07","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL and ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-14.el8_10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/openssl-libs@1.1.1k-14.el8_10?arch=x86_64&distro=rocky-8.10&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-1.1.1k-14.el8_10.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-14.el8_10"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-19211","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-19211","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"In ncurses 6.1, there is a NULL pointer dereference at function _nc_parse_entry in parse_entry.c that will lead to a denial of service attack.

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().

A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`\n2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same\n   hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set\n3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path='/'`).\n   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.\n4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer\n   boundary\n\nThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to\nthe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the\nsecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents\nimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.\n\nThe presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of\nthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding\nit on an insecure host should not be okay.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9086","epss":0.00077,"percentile":0.23388,"date":"2025-12-03"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"curl","version":"7.61.1-34.el8_10.8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-9086","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6769b32c0b4bb1bb","name":"libcurl-minimal","version":"7.61.1-34.el8_10.8","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:ba23add6c8d189365c9e024be58cc3f9c29dd979d85b5d926b8d8b74476e9a07","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libcurl-minimal:libcurl-minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libcurl-minimal:libcurl_minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libcurl_minimal:libcurl-minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libcurl_minimal:libcurl_minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libcurl:libcurl-minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libcurl:libcurl_minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:libcurl-minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:libcurl_minimal:7.61.1-34.el8_10.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/libcurl-minimal@7.61.1-34.el8_10.8?arch=x86_64&distro=rocky-8.10&upstream=curl-7.61.1-34.el8_10.8.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"curl","version":"7.61.1-34.el8_10.8"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-45322","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45322","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in libxml2.
