Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-48706","epss":0.00088,"percentile":0.26056,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"vim","version":"8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-48706","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"917c12294df6410e","name":"vim-minimal","version":"2:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:dcc6dd76a677edfb94b5be2be993cbc977f2f4c6f47379c2fa294c16a87d302b","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Vim and MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:vim-minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:vim_minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim-minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim_minimal:2\\:8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/vim-minimal@8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4?arch=x86_64&distro=rocky-8.10&epoch=2&upstream=vim-8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"vim","version":"8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-29768","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-29768","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in Vim's zip.vim plugin.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the

When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space left in the buffer to handle the next characters.  So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash.

This issue could allow an attacker with local access to provide specially crafted input, potentially causing the application to crash or allowing arbitrary code execution. This could result in a denial of service or unauthorized actions on the system.","cvss":[{"source":"sep@nlnetlabs.nl","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-43168","epss":0.00031,"percentile":0.07073,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"unbound","version":"1.16.2-5.9.el8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-43168","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1ea83ca3f62b25fd","name":"unbound-libs","version":"1.16.2-5.9.el8","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:dcc6dd76a677edfb94b5be2be993cbc977f2f4c6f47379c2fa294c16a87d302b","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:unbound-libs:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound-libs:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound_libs:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound_libs:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rocky:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/unbound-libs@1.16.2-5.9.el8?arch=x86_64&distro=rocky-8.10&upstream=unbound-1.16.2-5.9.el8.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"unbound","version":"1.16.2-5.9.el8"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-26603","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-26603","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in Vim's :redir command.

Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-26603","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.07934,"date":"2025-09-05"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"8.10"},"package":{"name":"vim","version":"8.0.1763-19.el8_6.4"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-26603","versionConstraint":"none
